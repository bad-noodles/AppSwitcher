# AppSwitcher

Swap between applications using keyboard shortcuts

`option+tab` shows the open applications and the letter assigned to them
While the application list is open, you can just press the assigned letter to open it.
You can switch directly to an application if you already know the letter assigned to it with `option+shift+<letter>`

To use it, just requires the `app_switcher` file from your lua config
require("./AppSwitcher/app_switcher")
